"""DELETES ANY device from the Harmony One (factory or added), without
moving a single byte of the body.

It's the mirror of `add_device.py`: where that one adds, extending `[9]`
(with `reubicar.relocate`) and stacking a new tail (headers, programs,
trailers, repointed `table[6]`), this one REMOVES -- makes a Devices menu
row unrecognizable and leaves everything that hung off it as unreachable
garbage. The same principle the WHOLE project uses (`relocate.py`,
`fourth_device.py`, `add_device.py`): "the bytes that stay where they were don't
get erased, they become unreachable, which is safer than compacting".

## WATCH OUT: this is NOT the mirror of `fourth_device.py`

An earlier version of this file mirrored `fourth_device.py` (which edits the
ROWS of SHEET 1, the 18 B `02 06/02 0b/04 3f` inserted in-place in the
menu object, addressed by `--ordinal/--row`). That technique is
HISTORICAL and pointed at the WRONG place for ADDED devices: today's blob
(`config_empaquetada.bin`, produced by `add_device.py`) adds them
as EXTRA ROWS on a separate SHEET 2 (the N>1 mechanism of `table[6]`,
`read_extra_rows`/`menu_sheet_layout`), not on sheet 1.

Measured against the real blob (`config_empaquetada.bin`):

    D.read_extra_rows(b, o, orden_menu)      -> 2: id_jump 2904 (Philips,
                                                  32 commands) and 2972 (LG,
                                                  63 commands) -- matches
                                                  `read_section5(b)` = [84, 62,
                                                  90, 32, 63]

Philips and LG are in `read_extra_rows`; TV/DVR/Home (0..2) are
on sheet 1 (`read_sheet1_rows`, below). This version deletes BOTH kinds,
with its own localization and repackaging for each -- see "TWO
localization paths" below.

## Why touching the menu row is enough

A command button is NEVER resolved by its position: it's resolved by
following pointers (row -> id_jump -> screen ordinal -> slots -> keyreg ->
id_a -> id_b -> {cmd_id,0x7D}/{dev_id,0x7C} -> section [5] by (k1,k2)). If
the ONE row that points to `id_jump` is removed, the rest of that chain
(the whole commands screen, its objects in `[10]`, its section [5]
sub-table) is left with no entry path from the menu. It's still "alive" in
the sense that it would resolve if something pointed to it -- but nothing
does. That's why there's no need to touch section [5] or tabla[6] beyond
that row: leaving them intact is SAFER than renumbering (renumbering a
`k1` from the middle would mean rewriting the `dev_id`/`cmd_id` of EVERY
command of the devices left with a higher index, exactly the kind of mass
change this project avoids).

## What DOES change

  1. `[9]` is extended (via `reubicar.relocate`, the same path
     `add_device.py` uses) with one new keyreg per extra sheet of the 3
     menu objects (74/90/141 in today's blob), already WITHOUT the deleted
     row and REPACKAGED with `menu_sheet_layout` -- the same function that
     builds an addition, run with one fewer row.
  2. Emitted to the tail: the extra sheets' new program(s), their slots,
     and a new trailer for each of the 3 menu objects (sheet 1, LEFT
     UNTOUCHED -- not even copied -- + the new extra sheets).
  3. The 3 `table[6]` entries (74/90/141) are REPOINTED in-place to those
     new trailers. It's a VALUE change of an existing pointer, not a data
     move -- the same kind of change `write.py` declares with
     `--repoint`.

## What does NOT change (on purpose), on NEITHER of the two paths

  * Section [5] in full, ALWAYS: the deleted device's sub-table stays
    there, pointing at records that are still valid, simply with nothing
    referencing it. `check_section5`/`resolve_section5` don't
    distinguish "not referenced" from "never used". That's why the "gap
    vs. renumbering" dilemma in section [5] is a FALSE dilemma for this
    design: neither is chosen, [5] stays byte for byte THE SAME no matter
    which device is deleted (factory or added), so `cmd_setup_ir` never
    sees a k1/k2 out of range because of this operation -- renumbering
    would touch the `dev_id`/`cmd_id` of EVERY command of the devices with
    a higher index (measured: 185 objects, 370 B, just to remove the
    DVR from a 5-device blob), and it wouldn't even close the
    risk: any other place in the blob that stores a raw `k1` without this
    project knowing about it (the Activities state machine, section
    [14]/[0], is a candidate) would end up wrong with nothing to detect
    it.
  * `table[6]`: the deleted device's commands-screen ordinal stays there,
    with its trailer intact -- just nothing jumps to it anymore.
  * The deleted device's `[10]`/`[11]` objects (commands, hooks, id_jump,
    id_volver).
  * The sheet that does NOT have the deleted row: if the device is ADDED,
    the 3 factory sheet-1s stay byte for byte UNTOUCHED, not even copied.
    If the device is FACTORY, the EXTRA sheets (if any) stay just as
    intact -- only the sheet that lost a row gets repackaged.

## TWO localization paths, one per device type

  * ADDED (index>=3): `locate_device` derives `id_jump` by
    ARITHMETIC over `table[11]` (valid because `reubicar.
    device_objects` assigns ids in a fixed order) and requires
    EXACT coverage (`found == expected`, the `n` commands from section [5]
    for that index) against the ONE screen it reaches.
  * FACTORY (index<3): that arithmetic does NOT apply (it gives an id that
    isn't even a valid jump object -- measured) and also the 3 menu
    objects (74/90/141) do NOT share a single id_jump for the same row
    (each has its own). `locate_sheet1_row` localizes PER OBJECT,
    walking each sheet-1 candidate FORWARD and requiring PURITY (every
    command found belongs to `dev_id` and no other) instead of full
    coverage: measured that a factory device can have MORE navigation
    routes to its commands than the Devices menu's (physical buttons,
    Activities) -- measured: Home resolves 58/90 commands from its single
    menu screen and DVR 18/62 from its own. This operation
    doesn't touch those routes or need to map them: section [5] doesn't
    change, so none of them can hang because of this -- it just loses the
    Devices menu entry, not necessarily "invisible" from every other path.

## The ONLY limit left: don't empty menu sheet 1

Doesn't distinguish factory from added. If the device to delete is the
last one still drawn on sheet 1, it aborts BEFORE touching anything: the
Devices menu would be left with no row to show, a state that doesn't
exist at the factory and that the generator itself can't emit.

The OLD limit ("the only added device can't be deleted, because going
back from N>1 to N=1 means restoring the 0xAE/0xAF strips and that
transition isn't exercised") NO LONGER EXISTS: it's solved by copying from
the factory. The N=1 header (the one declaring the 2 NULL strips) stays
alive-but-dead at its original offset -- the addition never erased it, it
just emitted a new one without strips and abandoned it -- so going back to
N=1 is just REPOINTING the trailer to that header. And there's no need to
have `config_raw.bin` on hand: `hdr_n1_de_fabrica()` BUILDS the shape it
would have (`<n+2> af 00 00 00 ae 00 00 00 <today's n entries>`, measured
byte for byte against the 3 factory menus) and SEARCHES for it inside the
blob itself; if it doesn't appear exactly once, it aborts.

## Mandatory checks (abort if they fail), the same for both paths

  (a) THE COMMANDS OF WHAT'S LEFT, exhaustive: every `(k1,k2)` of every
      remaining device -- and also those of the just-orphaned ONE -- is
      re-resolved with `cmd_setup_ir`'s exact arithmetic
      (`resolve_section5`). This is the check that prevents a HANG: the
      firmware walks `[5]` without checking range. It always holds because
      `[5]` never changes, and that's exactly why it's checked: if it ever
      did change, this check catches it before writing.
  (b) `reubicar.chain()`: PRE-EXISTING buttons resolve identically before
      and after.
  (c) no new structure crosses a 64 KB boundary (`crosses_page`).
  (d) `grabar.nothing_moved`, with its NEGATIVE (without declaring the
      repoints it has to say NO; if it said yes, the gate isn't looking at
      anything).
  (e) `configcheck.revisar()` all green.
  (f) THE ACTIVITIES (`activities.py`): the engine is section `[14]`, not
      `[0]`. `[0]` (the state-variable table) is IDENTICAL byte for byte
      with 0 and with 2 added devices, so any invariant over it is always
      green and discriminates nothing. What DOES discriminate is `[14]`'s
      transitive closure through `table[11]`: it gives the `cmd_id`s an
      activity can actually emit. It checks (f1) that `[14]`'s layout
      separates from its negatives, (f2) that the set of `k1` the engine
      reaches is the SAME before and after, (f3) that ALL those `cmd_id`
      resolve through section `[5]` -- i.e. no activity is left pointing
      at a nonexistent device -- and (f4) that the activities menu is left
      with the same rows.
  (g) NAVIGATION AND GEOMETRY: no sheet of the 3 menus references the cut
      `id_jump` again, AND -- what no earlier check looked at -- the row
      drawn at position `k` declares position `k`'s TOUCH ZONE
      (`mapa_de_menu`). The zones (`0xB0/0xB1/0xB2`) are geometric and
      fixed; compacting the rows requires REASSIGNING them. Without this
      check, a blob with the middle row drawn and the bottom zone declared
      passed (a)..(e) green: it looked fine and didn't respond to touch.
  (h) IDENTITY (factory path only): rebuilding sheet 1 with ALL its rows
      has to reproduce the original program and key register BYTE FOR
      BYTE. This is what guarantees "copy from the factory instead of
      inventing": it instantly catches a swapped ATTR, a generic icon
      glued on, or a different keyreg order.

## What the user is told

Nothing technical. `activities.human_sentences()` returns WHAT IS LOST in
plain sentences ("Home disappears from the device list, with its 90
commands and its screen" / "Your activities (TV HD and PC) use this
device. They are NOT deleted and will keep working the same way..."). It
is the SAME function `list_devices.py` uses for the app's confirmation, so the
screen and this tool can never say different things. With `--json`, all
of that comes out already resolved.

Usage:
    python3 delete_device.py <blob.bin> --indice 2 --salida new.bin

NOTE ON NAMING: `_decodificador` keeps its exact Spanish name --
`edit_activity.py`, `keys_physical.py`, and `keys_photo.py` all
`import erase` and call `erase._decodificador(...)` directly. The
`--repoint 0x......` text this script PRINTS (not just the CLI flag
itself) is also load-bearing: `app/api.py`'s `RE_REPUNTA` regex scrapes
this exact substring out of the subprocess's stdout to recover the
repoint list, so every `print(...)` that emits it keeps the literal
"--repunta" -- same reasoning as the CLI flags (`--index`, `--salida`,
`--json`, `--ezhex`, `--plantilla`), which stay as-is because
`app/generate.py` builds the command line with them. Everything else
(comments, docstrings, local names, and the rest of the printed/aborted
text) was translated freely, verified by diffing this script's output
blob byte for byte against the pre-translation baseline for the same
input and flags.

    2725/2726/2727/2728 for the same 3 TV/DVR/Home rows) -- so it has
    to be located PER OBJECT, not once for all 3.

    The criterion is PURITY, not full coverage: each sheet-1 row is
    followed to its screen (`resolve_screen`) and it's required that
    EVERY command found there belongs to `dev_id` and no other. It is NOT
    required that the screen cover the `n` commands section [5] declares
    for the device -- measured that it does NOT: Home resolves 58/90 from
    its single menu screen and DVR 18/62 from its own (figures an
    earlier version of this file had swapped, attributing DVR's to
    Home): a factory device can have more navigation routes to its
    commands than the Devices menu's (physical buttons, Activities), and
    this operation neither touches them nor needs to map them to safely
    cut THIS route -- section [5] never changes, so none of those other
    routes can hang because of this.

    Returns `{'cod','id_jump','screen_ordinal','hallados'}` or `None` if
    no row resolves, purely, to the device being searched for. Aborts if
    there's ambiguity (more than one pure row, or a mixed row that
    includes `dev_id` without being purely its own)."""

    Three things the previous version got wrong that are fixed here:

      1. **Doesn't require 3 rows.** Before, it compared `len(rows)`
         against `menu_order[:MAX_ROWS_PER_SHEET]` (always 3), so after
         deleting ONE factory device sheet 1 was left with 2 and a SECOND
         deletion aborted with "2 name row(s), expected 3" -- on top of
         having already repackaged section [9]. Now the row count comes
         from the PROGRAM (1..3) and each row's zone comes from its
         geometric POSITION, which is the real invariant.

      2. **Reads the real ATTR.** Factory sheet 1 declares `ATTR 4` before
         the first row; emitting `D.ATTR_FILA` (9) instead changes the
         anchor screen's font without anyone asking for it. Here the
         attribute in effect at the moment of the FIRST row is saved and
         re-emitted as-is.

      3. **Is also the ENTRY sync check.** It requires that the row at
         position `k` declares zone `menu_order[k]`, and that no row zone
         is left over with no row. If the input blob was already out of
         sync, it aborts here instead of propagating it.
