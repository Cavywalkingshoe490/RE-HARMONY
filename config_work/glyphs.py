"""The blob's glyph table: **decodes** the text it stores and **encodes** new text.

The blob does not store ASCII: it stores **glyph indices**, one byte per
character against a monoalphabetic table, terminated by `0x00` (see
`glyph_decode.py`).

`BASE` is the WHOLE table -- 71 of 71 codes -- and it comes from
`fonts.py`'s `GLYPHS`, which is read out of the blob's own font section [7]
(the bitmap of every glyph in 18 fonts) and pinned against the factory
texts. **It needs no account data.** For a while this file only had the 40
codes that had been cribbed by hand from known command names, and the rest
was filled in with the Hub's vocabulary; without that file the names came
out mutilated on screen (`?or?uler ??R` for `DVR`). They no longer
do -- see the block above `BASE`.

`extender()` stays because it is the historical derivation and it is still
a live cross-check: pointed at a vocabulary it re-derives the table by
elimination and must never contradict `BASE`. With `BASE` already complete
it learns nothing, which is the correct answer, not a failure. How it
works: the Hub's config carries hundreds of plaintext names
(`CommandTypeId`, `Name`, manufacturer and model of every device), and with
that the problem becomes a crossword puzzle:

    1. sweep the blob collecting strings <glyph bytes><0x00>
    2. for each string, search the vocabulary for words of the same length
       that **match at every position already known**
    3. if **exactly one** candidate survives, its new letters are new mappings
    4. repeat: every learned glyph disambiguates more strings, up to a fixed
       point

Step 3 is the one that provides the guarantee: **if two candidates survive,
nothing is learned**. And every new mapping is checked against collision -- if
two different letters claim the same glyph, or one letter claims two, it is
discarded. A monoalphabetic substitution is either bijective or it is not.

# THE TABLE IS COMPLETE: 71 of 71 codes, and it does NOT depend on the Hub.
#
# The table below (`CRIB_HISTORICA`) is what this file derived BY HAND
# against known command names: 40 codes. It is not wrong -- it is
# INCOMPLETE, and that is what put `?` on screen. `F`, `m`, `D`, `V`, `H`,
# `M`, `W`, `L`, `A`, `E`, `N`... simply were not in it, so `DVR`
# came out `?or?uler ??R` and any device the user added came out `??`. The
# hole was patched with the Hub's vocabulary (`hub/DeviceList.json`), which
# lets `extender()` learn 21 more codes by elimination -- but that file is
# the user's own account data, it is not published, and WITHOUT it the
# names came out mutilated.
#
# `fonts.py`'s `GLYPHS` closes it without any user data. It is derived from the
# blob itself: section [7] carries the BITMAP of every glyph in 18 fonts,
# and `fonts.py`'s `_check()` pins the 71 codes with four independent checks
# (shape of the 423 bitmaps, semantics of the factory texts, per-font
# repertoire, and the anchor "every code appears in at least one factory
# text"). That is a property of the FIRMWARE, not of a particular account.
#
# The two derivations are INDEPENDENT -- one reads names, the other reads
# pixels -- and they agree on the 40 codes they share. The assert below
# keeps them from drifting apart: if a future session touches either table
# and they stop agreeing, this file refuses to import instead of silently
# decoding one letter as another.
