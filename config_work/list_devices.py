"""Lists the devices declared in a Harmony One config blob.

Per device: name, section [5] index (`k1`), command count, ordinal of its
commands screen, and which menu sheet/row of the Devices menu it appears
in.

READS ONLY. Writes nothing, doesn't touch USB. Reuses the model already
verified on the device (`fourth_device.py`, `add_device.py`, `relocate.py`)
instead of reinventing it:

    menu (tabla[6][74/90/141], 3 replicas of the same menu -- ESTADO.md) ->
      N sheets (trailer <flag><header ptr24><u16 N><N x slot ptr24>) ->
        up to 3 rows per sheet, drawn at Y = 57, 111, 165
    row -> touch zone {id, 0x7F} in the sheet's key register ->
      section [11] object: {tipo,0x75} {ordinal,0x7E} {1,0x9A}
      -- the same pattern `device.jump_object()` emits
    ordinal -> tabla[6][ordinal] IS the device's commands screen
    screen -> its buttons resolve, with the SAME double jump
      `reubicar.chain()` walks ({0x7F} -> {0x7F} -> {cmd_id,0x7D}), to a
      cmd_id whose HIGH BYTE is `k1` -- the section [5] device index
      (add_device.py, `cmd_setup_ir`: "k1 = high byte of cmd_id")
    command count = `device.read_section5(b)[k1]['n']` -- the same
      number `device.check_section5()` already checks byte for byte
      against the factory blob (236/236: 84+62+90)

Names are decoded with `glyphs.py` (glyph indices, not ASCII), extending
the base table with the Hub's vocabulary if available.

GOLDEN CHECK: the 3 menu objects (74/90/141) have to return EXACTLY the
same set and order of devices -- if not, abort. And no screen may resolve
0 or >1 `k1` values -- if it does, abort.

## What is NOT an error: a `k1` declared but not referenced

Section [5]'s header can declare MORE devices than the menu reaches. That
is exactly what `delete_device.py` leaves behind, and it is the CORRECT state
after a removal: deleting unhooks the menu row and leaves section [5]'s
sub-table ORPHANED in place, because pulling it out of the middle would
renumber the `k1` of everything that follows, and the firmware
(`cmd_setup_ir`) walks that table WITHOUT a range check -- a `k2` outside
the sub-table HANGS the remote. So here the orphans are REPORTED
(`huerfanos_seccion5`), not treated as "the reader is broken": an earlier
version of this file aborted with "section [5] declares k1 in
[0,1,2,3,4] but the menu resolves [0,1,2,3]", i.e. it refused to list
exactly the blob a removal produces.

Usage:
    python3 list_devices.py <blob.bin> [--json out.json] [--hub <DeviceList.json>]

NOTE ON NAMING: `set_t6`, `make_decoder`, `k1_of_screen`,
`menu_rows`, `DEFAULT_HUB`, and `K1_DE_FABRICA` keep their exact
Spanish names -- `activities.py`, `delete_device.py`, `screen_activities.py`,
and `keys_map.py` all `import listar` directly and call them by name.
The dict keys these functions return/consume (`name`, `k1`,
`incomplete_glyphs`, `screen_ordinal`, `menu_ordinal`, `sheet`, `row`,
`zone`, `commands`, `de_fabrica`, `menu`, `ordinal_menu`, `devices`,
`huerfanos_seccion5`, `declarados_seccion5`, `menus`, `glyph_warning`) are
ALSO left in Spanish: this script's `--json` output is read by
`app/api.py` (`control_listar_dispositivos`) by these exact names and
flows on to `app/ui/app.js`. Everything else (comments, docstrings, and
every other local name) was translated freely.

#: read out of the blob's own font section [7]. This used to be load-bearing:
#: with the vocabulary missing (or with a cwd-relative default that silently
#: resolved to nothing) the names came out "T?", "?or?uler ??R", "?o?e", "??"

#:
#: NOT a format constant -- it's per-PHYSICAL-REMOTE data, hardcoded here.
#: It happens to equal menu sheet 1's row CAPACITY (`MAX_ROWS_PER_SHEET` in
#: `add_device.py`) only because this particular remote's factory devices
#: exactly filled sheet 1; that's a coincidence of this unit's factory
#: config, not something the format guarantees. And it can't be re-derived
#: from a blob AFTER devices have been added: once section [5] has more
#: than 3 sub-tables, nothing in the blob itself says which prefix was
#: there from the factory -- that fact only exists at first contact, before
#: any addition. The correct fix is to record it once per remote and thread
#: it through as a parameter instead of trusting this module-level default:
#: `config_work/read_flash_baseline.py::derivar()` measures
#: `n_dispositivos_actual` and flags `parece_de_fabrica`, and
#: `app/history.py::identify_or_create_remote()` only writes
#: `mandos.n_dispositivos_fabrica` when that flag is True. (The names matter:
#: an earlier version called the measurement `n_dispositivos_fabrica` and
#: took it from ANY dump, which on this remote's own already-written config
#: reports 5 devices / 158 screens as "factory" instead of 3 / 156.)
#: Not done here: `list_devices.py`/`delete_device.py`/`screen_activities.py`/
#: `keys_map.py` all read this name directly, and re-plumbing every call
#: site is real surgery on the load-bearing deletion path -- left as the
#: next step (see the audit this constant is part of), not attempted
#: without a live remote to verify against.
